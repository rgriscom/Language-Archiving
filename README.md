# Language-Archiving
This repository includes two short scripts designed to make it easier to prepare data and metadata files for language archives, such as the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR). The first of these scripts adds empty topic and keyword fields to IMDI files, a process that normally requires a lot of manual menu navigation in Arbil. The second script removes any empty keyword fields from IMDI files so that they can be uploaded to ELAR without impacting the archive metadata scheme. For questions, contact Richard T. Griscom at rgriscom@gmail.com.
